# Assembly-Line-Manager (C++ final project)
# simulates an assembly line, which adds items to products according to orders that their customers have placed.
* 
* Clearly defined Object-Oriented architecture by implementing compositions, aggregations and associations
* Parsed field-delimited data records into well-defined sets with high fault-tolerant and exception reporting
* Effectively managed product processing for each specific task using STL container and smart pointer
* Coordinated the interactions between the assembly lineâ€™s tasks using STL algorithms whose operations were 
* specified by lambda expression
